Created this project Spring 2014 for the [Congressional App Challenge](http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/). This small web app uses the Last.fm API to pull songs from a selected last.fm user and suggests one to the app user. Started and completed it in about 2 days with school hours in between. I used Bootstrap, Jquery, JS, and HTML/CSS. Also made a quick Android app for it using webviews and AppInventor. 

If for any reason you want to use any of my work in your own work, please contact me beforehand. Thanks! :)
